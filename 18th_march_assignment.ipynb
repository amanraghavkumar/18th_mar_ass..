    "* The filter method is a technique used in feature selection, which is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, attributes) from a larger set of features to be used in building a predictive model or conducting an analysis. The filter method involves evaluating the importance or relevance of individual features independently of any specific machine learning algorithm. It's called a \"filter\" because it acts as a preprocessing step to filter out features that may be less informative or redundant before feeding the data into a machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the filter method work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scoring: In the filter method, each feature is assigned a score or rank based on some statistical measure or criterion. Common scoring methods used include correlation, chi-squared test, information gain, and variance threshold.\n",
    "Independence: Features are scored independently of each other and the target variable. This means that the score of a feature is calculated without considering its relationship with other features or how well it might contribute to predicting the target variable.\n",
    "Threshold: A threshold is set based on some criterion, such as selecting the top N highest-scoring features or setting a threshold value for the scores.\n",
    "Feature Selection: Features that meet the threshold criteria are selected and retained for further analysis or model building, while those below the threshold are discarded."
